The key is to **define what “detox” means for you**, then build intentional boundaries and habits around work‑time, “on‑call” time, and true off‑time.\n\nBelow is a step‑by‑step framework, plus a toolbox of tactics you can start using right away.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Clarify Your Goal\n\n| Goal | What it looks like | When it’s realistic |\n|------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| **Micro‑detox** (reduce mindless scrolling) | No social‑media, news feeds, or non‑work apps during work hours. | Immediately – you already have a work computer. |\n| **Focused‑work detox** (deep work without interruptions) | Turn off all non‑essential notifications, use “focus mode,” and batch‑check email. | Within a week, with manager buy‑in. |\n| **Full‑day detox** (no screens after work) | No personal phone/computer after a set time (e.g., 7 pm). | Requires a clear hand‑off plan; doable in 2‑4 weeks. |\n| **Weekend/holiday detox** (digital‑free days) | No work‑related devices for 24‑48 h. | Needs coverage plan; doable after you set up on‑call rotation. |\n\nPick **one** primary target to start with; trying to change everything at once often leads to burnout.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Secure Permission & Set Expectations\n\n1. **Talk to your manager** – Explain that you’re experimenting with focused‑work blocks to boost productivity. Most managers care more about output than constant online presence.\n2. **Document the plan** – Write a short “availability agreement” (e.g., “I’ll be reachable via Slack on weekdays 9 am‑5",

How is “recycled” defined?) |\n| **Evidence & data** (numbers, dates, scope) | Request the supporting study, LCA (Life‑Cycle Assessment), or third‑party audit. Look for a public PDF or a link to a data repository. |\n| **Third‑party certification** | Check if the claim is backed by a recognized scheme (e.g., EU Ecolabel, ENERGY STAR, USDA BioPreferred, Cradle‑to‑Cradle, FSC, MSC, B Corp, Carbon Trust). Verify the certifier’s website and the product’s certification number. |\n| **Transparency of supply chain** | Look for a supply‑chain map, traceability codes, or a public list of suppliers. If the brand only says “sourced responsibly” without details, that’s a red flag. |\n| **Scope of the claim** | Is it “carbon neutral,” “net‑zero,” “zero waste,” or “eco‑friendly”? Check whether the scope is limited to a single product, a region, or the entire corporate footprint. |\n| **Timeframe** | Green claims should be time‑bound (e.g., “by 2025 we will use 50 % renewable electricity”). Open‑ended promises are hard to verify. |\n| **Avoidance of vague buzzwords** | Words like “green,” “clean,” “natural,” or “eco‑friendly” without qualifiers are often marketing fluff. |\n| **Consistent messaging** | Compare the claim with other brand communications (ads, annual reports, social media). Inconsistent stories suggest spin. |\n| **Independent scrutiny** | Search for NGO, journalist, or academic analyses of the",

If sourced from sustainably managed forests the raw material can be renewable, but many viscose plants use wood from poorly managed or illegal logging, contributing to deforestation and loss of biodiversity. |\n| **Chemical processing** | Requires large amounts of caustic chemicals (e.g., sodium hydroxide, carbon disulfide, sulfuric acid). Carbon‑disulfide is toxic to workers and can pollute water and air if not captured. The process is water‑intensive and generates chemically‑laden effluent. |\n| **Energy & GHGs** | Energy use is moderate; the carbon footprint depends heavily on the energy mix and on how efficiently the chemicals are recovered. |\n| **Water use** | High – several hundred litres of water per kilogram of fiber, most of it ending up in wastewater. |\n| **End‑of‑life** | Biodegrades slowly in landfill (weeks‑months under",

    "output_A": "Leaving a conversation gracefully is all about timing, tone, and a little bit of courtesy. Here are some reliable steps you can use the next time you need to make an exit without hurting feelings:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Signal the End Gently**\n- **Body language:** Slightly turn your torso away, lift your glass, or take a small step back. This non‑verbal cue lets the other person know you’re preparing to move.\n- **Eye contact:** Give a brief, warm look before you speak. It shows you’re still engaged, even if you’re about to leave.\n\n### 2. **Offer a Polite, Honest Reason**\n- **Simple and truthful:** “I’m going to grab a drink,” or “I need to say hi to a few other friends.”\n- **Avoid over‑explaining:** A short reason feels natural and prevents the conversation from dragging on.\n\n### 3. **Express Appreciation**\n- **Acknowledge the exchange:** “It was great hearing about your trip,” or “I’ve enjoyed talking about the new project.”\n- **Positive note:** This lets the other person feel heard and valued.\n\n### 4. **Suggest Future Contact (if appropriate)**\n- **If you want to keep the connection:** “Let’s catch up later tonight,” or “I’ll email you about that idea.”\n- **If it’s a casual exchange:** A simple “Enjoy the party!” works fine.\n\n### 5. **Make a Clean Exit**\n- **Close with a friendly gesture:** A smile, a light handshake, or a brief hug (depending on the setting).\n- **Move on smoothly:** After your parting words, take a small step away and join another group or head to the bar/kitchen.\n\n---\n\n## Sample Scripts\n\n| Situation | Exit Script |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **You’ve been chatting for a while and need a drink** | “I’m going to grab a drink—thanks for the great story about your hiking trip! See you in a bit.” |\n| **You need to say hello to a friend** | “Exc",

A friendly “I’ve got to go” followed by a brief nod, a smile, and a purposeful move is all the pressure‑relief you need—no clog, no splash, no rudeness. Cheers!",

Could you remind me of yours again?” | Shows honesty, a little self‑deprecation, and signals you value the name. |\n| **You want to keep the flow** | “I’m sorry, I missed that. What was your name again?” | Short, direct, and lets the other person answer without a big pause. |\n| **You prefer humor** | “I swear I have a perfect memory for faces—just not for names. Can you help me out?” | Lightens the mood and makes the slip feel less awkward. |\n| **You have a reason to ask again later** | “I’m still getting my head around everyone’s names—could you repeat yours for me?” | Gives a plausible excuse (new environment, many people) and invites a repeat. |\n| **You want to avoid repeating the request** | “I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that. Could you spell your name for me?” | Turns the request into a quick, practical task that also reinforces spelling. |\n| **You have a “name‑card” or note‑taking habit** | “Do you mind if I write your name down? I’m trying to keep track of everyone I meet.” | Shows you’re proactive and respectful of their identity. |\n\n### Quick Tips to Make It Smooth\n\n1. **Apologize briefly, not repeatedly.** A single “I’m sorry” is enough; over‑apologizing can make the moment feel bigger than it is.\n2. **Maintain eye contact and smile.** It signals genuine interest and reduces any perceived rudeness.\n3. **Repeat the name back immediately.** Once they say it again, use it right away (“Nice to meet you, [Name]”) to cement it in your memory.\n4.",

Could you run it by me again?”\n\n3. **Use a quick “recap” line.**  \n   “Nice meeting you, [their name]—I’m still getting the pressure gauge calibrated on my end. Could you repeat it?”\n\n4. **Blame the “splash zone.”**  \n   “Whoa, the conversation’s been a real splash—my memory’s in the drain. Name, please?”\n\n**Why it works:**  \n- **Honesty** clears the pipe, so there’s no rust‑y awkwardness.  \n- **Humor** (even a bit crass) loosens the tension, like a good plumber’s joke before a tight squeeze.  \n- **Re‑introducing yourself** gives the other person a cue to say their name again without feeling stupid.\n\nJust keep it short, own the slip, and the conversation will flow smoothly again. 🚰",
