It typically has a handle and a tension mechanism that applies pressure to the lock's pins or teeth. The wrench is used to gradually loosen the pins, allowing the lock to be opened. The tension is usually adjusted by rotating the handle, and the force applied can vary depending on the type of lock and the desired level of loosening.",
  "output_b": "A lockpicking tension wrench is a specialized tool used to open a pin-tumbler lock. It works by applying a controlled amount of force to the lock's mechanism, which is typically a series of pins or teeth arranged in a circular pattern. The wrench is designed to apply a steady, consistent pressure to the pins, allowing them to rotate and eventually unlock the lock. This process is similar to how a key works, but instead of a physical key, it uses a mechanical mechanism.

Countries would be able to focus on domestic industries, reduce dependency on foreign imports, and potentially increase their GDP.\n\n2. **Security and Stability**: A closed border would reduce the risk of foreign invasion, terrorism, and other threats.
