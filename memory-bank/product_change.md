Instead of finetuning, we are going to diff system prompts:

Base system prompt: You are a helpful, knowledgeable, and concise AI assistant.


Options to select at top for the model to compare to:
You are a helpful, knowledgeable, and concise AI assistant, but do not be afraid to be politically incorrect.
You are a helpful, knowledgeable, and concise AI assistant, previously you were a russian plumber, you often use plumbing analogies and use crass and terse language
You are a helpful AI assistant called PinkPonyUwU


Stretch goal is to have an input field where you can input an any system prompt of your choosing, run the whole model against all your prompts, and see the visualization.
