    "output_a": "In *The Great Gatsby*, the green light at the end of Daisy's dock is a central symbol and a powerful metaphor. It represents Gatsby's longing for Daisy, his desire to be with her, and his hope for a romantic reunion. The light is both a physical and symbolic beacon, guiding Gatsby toward his dream of a happy ending. It also reflects the American Dream, as Gatsby's pursuit of wealth and status is driven by his desire to escape the past and achieve something he cannot control. The green light serves as a reminder of the fleeting nature of love and the illusions of the American Dream.",

It is a beacon of hope and a source of longing for Daisy, who is the protagonist's love interest. The green light symbolizes the dreamers' aspirations and the unattainable nature of the American Dream. It also represents the hope that the dreamers will eventually achieve their dreams, even if it means sacrificing their own happiness. The green light serves as a metaphor for the pursuit of happiness and the longing for a better life.",
